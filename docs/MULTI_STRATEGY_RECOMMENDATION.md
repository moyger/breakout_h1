# Multi-Strategy Recommendation

## Question
Should we:
1. Add EUR/GBP or AUD/NZD mean reversion to existing breakout strategy?
2. Run as separate strategy alongside breakout?

## Answer: **Run as SEPARATE STRATEGIES**

---

## Strategy Portfolio Design

### Strategy 1: Breakout (Trending Pairs)
**Pairs**: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY
**Session**: London (3 AM - 12 PM EST)
**Logic**: Trade breakouts of Asia range with trend filter
**Expected**: 45 trades/pair/year, 49% WR, $1,738/pair/year

### Strategy 2: Mean Reversion (Ranging Pairs)
**Pairs**: EUR/GBP, AUD/NZD
**Session**: Asia for AUD/NZD, London for EUR/GBP
**Logic**: Buy low, sell high within daily range
**Expected**: TBD (needs backtesting)

---

## Why SEPARATE is Better Than Combined

### 1. **Opposite Market Regimes**

**Breakout pairs (EUR/USD)**:
- Need: Volatility, momentum, trending
- Avoid: Low volatility, ranging, choppy

**Mean reversion pairs (EUR/GBP)**:
- Need: Stable range, correlation, low volatility
- Avoid: Breakouts, trending, high volatility

**Problem if combined**: Filters that work for breakouts KILL mean reversion and vice versa.

**Example**:
```python
# Breakout strategy needs:
if h4_trend == direction and momentum > 15 pips:
    enter_breakout()

# Mean reversion needs OPPOSITE:
if h4_trend_strength < 0.002 and volatility < 30 pips:
    enter_mean_reversion()
```

These are **mutually exclusive conditions**.

---

### 2. **Different Session Timing**

| Pair | Best Session | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| EUR/USD | London | Breaks out at London open |
| GBP/USD | London | Breaks out at London open |
| EUR/GBP | London | Ranges during London (both home) |
| AUD/NZD | **Asia** | Both currencies active, ranges tight |

**AUD/NZD doesn't even trade during same hours as EUR/USD breakout!**

---

### 3. **Different Risk Profiles**

**Breakout**:
- Wide stops (20-40 pips)
- Wide targets (30-50 pips)
- Hold 3-4 hours
- Hit rate: ~49%

**Mean Reversion**:
- Tight stops (10-15 pips)
- Tight targets (15-25 pips)
- Hold 1-2 hours
- Hit rate: ~60-70% (when works)

**Problem if combined**: Position sizing and risk calculations become complex.

---

### 4. **Easier to Debug and Optimize**

**Separate strategies**:
```python
# Clear separation
breakout_trades = run_breakout_strategy(['EURUSD', 'GBPUSD'])
mr_trades = run_mean_reversion(['EURGBP', 'AUDNZD'])

# Easy to analyze
if breakout_trades.losing_streak > 5:
    investigate_breakout_logic()
if mr_trades.win_rate < 60%:
    investigate_mean_reversion_logic()
```

**Combined strategy**:
```python
# Messy
if pair in ['EURUSD', 'GBPUSD']:
    if h4_trending:
        use_breakout_logic()
    else:
        use_mean_reversion_logic()
elif pair in ['EURGBP', 'AUDNZD']:
    # Different logic entirely
```

Hard to debug when something breaks.

```
Portfolio Manager
├── Breakout Strategy (London Session)
│   ├── EUR/USD (45 trades/year, $1,738/year)
│   ├── GBP/USD (45 trades/year, $1,738/year)
│   └── USD/JPY (45 trades/year, $1,738/year)
│   Total: 135 trades/year, $5,214/year

└── Mean Reversion Strategy (Asia + London)
    ├── EUR/GBP (London, ? trades/year)
    └── AUD/NZD (Asia, ? trades/year)
    Total: TBD
```

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extend Breakout to More Pairs ✅ SAFE
**Goal**: Triple breakout strategy capacity
**Pairs to add**: GBP/USD, USD/JPY
**Expected**: 135 trades/year, $5,214/year
**Risk**: Low (same proven strategy, just more pairs)
**Time**: 1-2 days to backtest and validate

### Phase 2: Build Mean Reversion Strategy 🔬 EXPERIMENTAL
**Goal**: Develop new MR strategy for ranging pairs
**Pairs**: EUR/GBP first, then AUD/NZD
**Expected**: Unknown (needs research)
**Risk**: Medium (new strategy type, needs validation)
**Time**: 1 week to develop and backtest

### Phase 3: Combine Portfolio 🎯 ADVANCED
**Goal**: Run both strategies simultaneously
**Challenge**: Risk management across strategies
**Benefit**: Diversification (breakout + MR uncorrelated)
**Time**: 2-3 days to integrate

## Why EUR/GBP for Mean Reversion

### Pros ✅
1. **True mean reversion**: Economic correlation keeps it ranging
2. **Liquid**: Tight spreads (1-2 pips), good execution
3. **London session**: Same hours as our EUR/USD strategy
4. **Proven**: Many successful MR strategies use EUR/GBP

### Cons ⚠️
1. **Low volatility**: Smaller profit per trade
2. **Can trend**: Brexit, policy divergence can cause temporary trends
3. **Correlated to EUR/USD**: Both have EUR exposure

### Expected Performance (Educated Guess)
Based on typical EUR/GBP MR strategies:
- Trades: 60-80/year
- Win rate: 60-65%
- Avg win: $80-100
- Avg loss: $60-80
- Annual P&L: $1,000-1,500/year

## Why AUD/NZD for Mean Reversion

### Pros ✅
1. **Strongest MR pair**: Extremely correlated economies
2. **Very tight range**: 10-30 pips/day (perfect for MR)
3. **Uncorrelated to EUR/USD**: True diversification
4. **High win rate**: MR works very well (70%+ achievable)

### Cons ⚠️
1. **Low volatility**: Small profits per trade
2. **Wide spreads**: 3-5 pips typical (eats into profit)
3. **Asia session**: Different hours than London (need separate monitoring)
4. **Slow**: May take months to accumulate significant P&L

### Expected Performance (Educated Guess)
Based on typical AUD/NZD MR strategies:
- Trades: 40-60/year
- Win rate: 65-70%
- Avg win: $60-80
- Avg loss: $50-70
- Annual P&L: $800-1,200/year

## Complete Portfolio Projection

| Strategy | Pair | Trades/Year | Annual P&L | Risk Type |
|----------|------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Breakout** | EUR/USD | 45 | $1,738 | Trend following |
| **Breakout** | GBP/USD | 45 | $1,738 | Trend following |
| **Breakout** | USD/JPY | 45 | $1,738 | Trend following |
| **Mean Rev** | EUR/GBP | 70 | $1,250 | Range bound |
| **Mean Rev** | AUD/NZD | 50 | $1,000 | Range bound |
| **TOTAL** | - | **255** | **$9,464** | **Diversified** |

**Benefits**:
- ✅ 255 trades/year (5× more than v3 alone)
- ✅ Diversified: Breakout + MR strategies (uncorrelated)
- ✅ Multi-session: London + Asia coverage
- ✅ FTMO: Could hit +10% in 30-45 days in good conditions

## My Specific Recommendation

### Step 1: THIS WEEK - Backtest EUR/GBP Mean Reversion
**Why EUR/GBP first?**
- Same London session (easy to integrate)
- More liquid than AUD/NZD (lower spreads)
- If it works, add immediately to portfolio

**Approach**:
```python
# EUR/GBP Mean Reversion Strategy
# - Trade during London session
# - Buy when price near daily low + RSI < 35
# - Sell when price near daily high + RSI > 65
# - Target: Mid-range or 50% retracement
# - SL: 15 pips
# - TP: 20-25 pips
```

**Success criteria**:
- Win rate > 55%
- Profit factor > 1.3
- At least 40 trades/year
- Max DD < 3%

### Step 2: NEXT WEEK - Add GBP/USD Breakout
**Why?**
- Exact same strategy as EUR/USD (proven)
- Doubles breakout opportunities
- Low risk (just applying existing logic)

### Step 3: LATER - Consider AUD/NZD
**Only if**:
- EUR/GBP MR works well
- You want Asia session coverage
- You have bandwidth to monitor different hours

## Code Architecture

### Separate Strategy Files (Recommended)
```
strategies/
├── strategy_breakout_v3.py          (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY)
├── strategy_mean_reversion_eurgbp.py (EUR/GBP specific)
└── strategy_mean_reversion_audnzd.py (AUD/NZD specific)

portfolio_manager.py  (runs all strategies, combines results)
```

### Single Multi-Strategy File (NOT Recommended)
```
strategies/
└── strategy_multi.py  (messy, hard to debug)
```

---

## Risk Management Across Strategies

### Key Question: Can we have multiple positions at once?

**Option A: One position at a time (SIMPLE)**
```python
if no_position:
    # Check all strategies
    signal = check_breakout() or check_mean_reversion()
    if signal:
        open_position(signal)
```

**Option B: Multiple positions allowed (COMPLEX but BETTER)**
```python
# Can have:
# - 1 breakout position (EUR/USD)
# - 1 mean reversion position (EUR/GBP)
# Total exposure: 2% risk

max_total_risk = 2.0%  # FTMO safe
max_positions = 2

if total_risk < max_total_risk and num_positions < max_positions:
    if breakout_signal:
        open_position(breakout_signal, risk=0.8%)
    if mr_signal:
        open_position(mr_signal, risk=0.8%)
```

**Recommendation**: Option B (multiple positions) for diversification, but keep total exposure <= 2%.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow)
1. ✅ Decide: Separate strategies or combined?
   - **Answer**: SEPARATE
2. 🔬 Backtest EUR/GBP mean reversion (2023-2025)
3. 📊 Compare to EUR/USD breakout results

### This Week
4. If EUR/GBP MR is profitable → integrate into portfolio
5. Backtest GBP/USD breakout (should match EUR/USD results)
6. Create portfolio_manager.py to run both strategies

### Next Week
7. Paper trade combined portfolio (breakout + MR)
8. Monitor performance and correlation
9. Consider adding AUD/NZD if bandwidth allows

---

## Conclusion

**Recommendation**: **RUN AS SEPARATE STRATEGIES**

**Why?**
1. ✅ Easier to develop, test, debug
2. ✅ Different pairs suit different strategies
3. ✅ Different sessions (London vs Asia)
4. ✅ Better risk management (clear separation)
5. ✅ Easier to scale (add pairs independently)

**Don't combine** breakout + MR into single strategy:
- ❌ Opposite market regimes (trending vs ranging)
- ❌ Conflicting filters
- ❌ Complex to debug
- ❌ Hard to optimize

**Do build** a strategy portfolio:
- ✅ Strategy 1: Breakout (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY)
- ✅ Strategy 2: Mean Reversion (EUR/GBP, AUD/NZD)
- ✅ Portfolio manager combines both

**Start with EUR/GBP MR next** - same session as breakout, easy to integrate.
