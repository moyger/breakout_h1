## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "MT5 initialization failed"

**Cause:** MT5 not running or wrong settings

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check MT5 is running
# Check Tools ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Expert Advisors ‚Üí Allow automated trading
# Restart MT5
# Try again
```

#### 2. "No trades being taken"

**Possible causes:**
- Not trading hours (3-11 AM GMT)
- Not trading day (weekdays only)
- Safety stop triggered
- PAPER_TRADE_MODE=True and no simulation logic

**Check:**
```python
# In live_trader.py logs
# Look for: "Trading disabled: <reason>"
```

#### 3. "Daily loss limit triggered early"

**Cause:** Account already had losses before system started

**Fix:**
- Restart system at start of new day
- Or adjust `DAILY_START_BALANCE` in safety manager

#### 4. "Positions not closing"

**Cause:** Exit logic not yet implemented (TODO in code)

**Temporary fix:**
- Manually close positions in MT5
- Monitor carefully until exit logic completed

## Risk Disclosure

**READ THIS CAREFULLY:**

2. **Can Lose Money:** You can lose your entire FTMO account. The -9.78% max DD is based on historical data and could be exceeded.

3. **FTMO Rules:** One violation = account terminated. This system has safety stops but they may not always work.

4. **Technical Risk:** Software bugs, internet outages, MT5 issues can cause losses.

5. **Market Risk:** Strategy may stop working if market conditions change.

6. **Psychological Risk:** Watching losses can cause emotional decisions that override the system.

**By using this system, you accept full responsibility for all trading results.**
